This contains all the function definitions for the grid system, if more fuctions are added here make sure to place the prototype in battlegrid.h or things may break.
the header file is important here. there is alot of pointer use here to move data in and out of the functions to main.c 
NOTE---> Variable are initialized in the fuctions not in the beginning of the file, variables and pointes in use are listed below for reference
variable ---> description
bg       ---> pointer
i        --->  integer for row indexing
j        --->   integer for column indexing
arrayGrid ---> for testing the read fuction
MAX_GAME_ROWS---> defined in header
MAX_GAME_COLS---> defined in header
rowLabels --->  characters for row headers
colLabels --->  characters for column headers
MAX_VIS_ROWS ---> defined in header
MAX_VIS_COLs ---> defined in header
actualRow ---> The variable used to shift index placement between the reference grid and visual grid 
actualCol ---> Same as above but just for columns (sorry in advance if these are confusing names because of the rowGuess and colGuess within main.c)
